Or even American history and Hindu temples! While exploring, get to know locals from all over the world.\r\nWith every nationality we suggest a few words (thank you, good morning, etc) in the local language to help break the ice. Users can also take pictures of the people they meet. Collect and share all the 178 nationalities in your gallery!\r\n\r\nAmsterdam hosts 178 nationalities, more than any other city in the world! That's what triggered the idea. Still the idea can easily be adopted by other major cities in Europe: 151 X Paris, 148 X London, etc. Explore North-African Paris, or Jamaican London!\r\n\r\n## Who would benefit from it and how?\r\n\r\n * Locals living in Amsterdam\r\n * Ex-pats living in Amsterdam\r\n * Immigrants living in Amsterdam\r\n * tourists visiting Amsterdam (Or any other city in Europe when the idea is adopted to those cities).\r\n\r\nThe city itself would benefit mostly because the idea aims to encourage social and intercultural interaction.\r\n\r\n## What data do you think you need in order to build it?\r\n\r\nDatasources: The list of Amsterdam nationalities provided by the city. The location content comes from other sources. A list of monuments and memorials in the public space could also be helpful as they can often be linked to nationalities.\r\n\r\nThe app can be updated every year when the list of nationalities is also updated. Next year the app could be called: 179 X Amsterdam!\r\n\r\n## If you have any supporting material (video clips, pictures, or other resources), please list details and links below.\r\n\r\nCheck our clickable demo [here](www.fonkmobile.nl/clients/178xAmsterdam/) showing the basic functionality with some content.
